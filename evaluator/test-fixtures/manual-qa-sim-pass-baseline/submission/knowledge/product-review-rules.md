## Open questions (not stated in any source)

| # | Question area | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| OQ1 | Purchase check | The story says "a product I purchased". Must the system check the purchase? Can a non-buyer or a guest submit? Must the customer be signed in? |
| OQ2 | Rating values | Whole stars only or half stars? Is 0 / no rating allowed? |
| OQ3 | Review length | Minimum and maximum length of the review text. The demo build shows a "0 / 500" counter (Observed), but the story gives no limit. |
| OQ4 | Name and Email rules | Length limits, allowed characters, email format rule. |
| OQ5 | Messages | Wording and position of validation and success messages. |
| OQ6 | Moderation | Who approves, how, can a review be rejected, is the author told the result? What does the author see while the review is pending? |
| OQ7 | Display | Which details are shown per review (name or something else), date format, order, paging, what is shown when there are no reviews. |
| OQ8 | Rating summary | Does the product page show an average rating and review count, and is it based on approved reviews only? |
| OQ9 | Multiple reviews | Can one customer review the same product more than once? Edit or delete own review? |
| OQ10 | "Save my name, email, and website" | The checkbox mentions "website" but the mockup has no Website field. What is saved, where, and for how long? |
| OQ11 | Content rules | Are profanity, links or HTML in reviews filtered or blocked? |
| OQ12 | Scope | Supported browsers and devices beyond Chrome. |
